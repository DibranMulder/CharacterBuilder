# Creature roster and 1–120 encounter progression

## Purpose

This is a text-only curation roster for creatures across the twelve current
Territories. It deliberately precedes concept art, silhouettes, animation
planning, drops, and final balance. Every five-level cohort contains exactly
eight marquee creatures, targeting **192 marquee candidates across levels
1–120**. The eight reusable starter-threat archetypes below are additional:
64 marquee entries plus eight starter archetypes are currently drafted (72
named designs); the eventual combined target is 200, not 200 completed designs.

> **Curation sequence:** levels 1–40 are drafted below. Higher cohorts are
> intentionally paused until the Combat Class and 1–120 equipment catalogue is
> curated. No creature is assigned an item drop in this document.

The roster assumes that “good” and “bad” describe a creature's **Disposition**,
not its Allegiance. Light is not automatically good and Dark is not
automatically evil. A kind creature can live in the Underdeep; a dangerous
predator can live in the Open Lands.

## Proposed level model

Use **Adventure Level 1–120** as the Hero and encounter progression scale while
keeping the existing twelve Discipline levels at 1–99. Adventure Level governs
Zones, creatures, quests, equipment requirements, and ordinary combat power;
Disciplines continue to express trained breadth. This avoids stretching every
Discipline to 120 merely because the adventure campaign needs 24 content bands.

Accepted 2026-09-08: this model supersedes DESIGN-0007's Overall-Level Talent
budget. Class Talent Points use DESIGN-0013: `floor(Adventure Level / 10)`,
maximum twelve at 120. Overall Level remains a Discipline summary only.
Adventure XP comes from server-validated encounters, quests and exploration
objectives, not from averaging Discipline levels. Exact XP awards and the
Adventure XP curve remain balance work; no second Talent currency is granted.

Encounter rules for this roster:

- A normal Zone uses creatures within two levels of its recommendation.
- An Elite normally sits at the top of its five-level cohort.
- A Boss may exceed the Zone recommendation by one or two levels.
- Early Homeland cohorts give every Lineage a local 1–40 path.
- Frontiers and their Dungeons dominate 41–60 and 81–100.
- Veteran Homeland threats return at 61–80.
- Levels 101–120 bring mythic creatures, deepest Dungeon encounters, and
  world-scale threats.

## Disposition vocabulary

| Disposition | World behavior | Reward principle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Benevolent | Helps Heroes, protects a place, guides travel, or offers a quest interaction | Not a normal farming target; rewards come from aid, defense, discovery, or friendship |
| Neutral | Ignores Heroes unless threatened, cornered, or provoked | Can be avoided; hunting may affect reputation or ecology |
| Hostile | Hunts, guards territory aggressively, or attacks on sight | Standard combat and loot target |
| Corrupted | A creature or construct twisted away from its healthy nature | May be defeated normally, but cleansing or rescue should sometimes be possible |

**Stronghold Guardians are excluded.** They enforce Allegiance boundaries and
remain Stronghold Guardians rather than Monsters, even when they use creature
bodies. Named quest Characters are also outside this roster.

## Terrain coverage

| Terrain family | Territory | Main progression presence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meadows, rivers, roads, hill keeps | Open Lands | 1–40, 61–80, 101–105, 116–120 |
| Reefs, mangroves, tidal terraces, flooded halls | Tidekin Sea | 1–40, 61–80, 101–105, 116–120 |
| Ancient canopy, root roads, luminous clearings | Elder Forests | 1–40, 61–80, 101–105, 116–120 |
| Floating mesas, wind bridges, cloud forests | Sky Reaches | 1–40, 61–80, 101–105, 116–120 |
| Storm peaks, quarries, sheer passes | Broken Mountains | 1–40, 61–80, 101–105, 116–120 |
| Fungal caverns, rails, crystal seams | Underdeep | 1–40, 61–80, 101–105, 116–120 |
| Dunes, basalt canyons, salt flats, cistern roads | Ember Desert | 1–40, 61–80, 101–105, 116–120 |
| Glaciers, black ridges, aurora fields | Ice Lands | 1–40, 61–80, 101–105, 116–120 |

| Jungle, sinkholes, giant flora, lost temples | Verdant Maw | 41–60, 81–115 |

## Levels 1–40 — Homeland creatures

Each cohort includes one creature from every Homeland so any Lineage can begin
near its own culture without being forced into the Human starting region.

### Accepted solo starter floor — 2026-09-08

The marquee roster is flavor and optional encounter variety, not the only
source of progression. Every Homeland must provide the following in each of
the eight five-level bands from 1–5 through 36–40:

- A repeatable ordinary solo combat objective against local Common threats,
  with the same level-relative health, damage, telegraph and reward budgets.
- A repeatable aid, gathering-delivery or route-restoration objective granting
  comparable Adventure XP and currency per expected completion time. Combat
  is not required to farm benevolent creatures; these objectives have validated
  completion conditions and cannot grant XP for repeatedly toggling one switch.
- Enough earned currency for the relevant baseline NPC supplies, a safe recovery
  point in every Map, and a route not requiring an Elite kill, party, specific
  Class, flight ability, or unsupported equipment slot.
- Optional Elites with visible danger labels off the mandatory route. The Ice
  Lands' existing Elite entries stay optional; Rimeborn do not start harder.

These Common archetypes supply the combat floor. Each has eight level-band
variants using shared art and behavior; the server assigns levels within two
of the Zone recommendation. They are additional to, not replacements for,
benevolent and Elite marquee creatures:

| Homeland | Common hostile archetype | Readable solo behavior | Equivalent noncombat objective |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Open Lands | Hedge Nibbler | Pauses before a short ground bite | Restore roadside markers and protect Puffkin grazing patches |
| Tidekin Sea | Silt Skitter | Raises a claw before a short sideways lunge | Clear blocked tidal channels and guide stranded Ripplefin |
| Elder Forests | Briar Mite | Curls visibly before a short hop | Clear invasive brambles and tend Rootling seed plots |
| Sky Reaches | Draft Midge | Hovers, signals, then dives onto reachable platforms | Repair wind markers and recover courier bundles along ground-accessible routes |
| Broken Mountains | Shale Crawler | Braces its shell before a short roll | Secure loose stones and restore quarry warning posts |
| Underdeep | Pipe Nibbler | Shakes before a short spark spit | Unblock vents and restore fungal irrigation |
| Ember Desert | Sand Scrabbler | Marks its emergence before a short sand rush | Repair shade screens and deliver sealed cistern water |
| Ice Lands | Snowtick | Raises its front legs before a short leap | Restore trail warmth shelters and carry supplies between nearby safe posts |

Variant strength follows Adventure Level, not Allegiance. Early versions use
one attack and no unavoidable control; later bands may vary timing without
requiring a new body rig. Exact XP, currency and prices are balanced together
against completion time, consumable use and death rate, not simply equal kills.

Before accepting a Homeland's 1–40 path, test all six Classes and relevant body
topologies through all eight bands. Verify both objective types, affordable NPC
restocking, same-Map respawn/relogin, and no mandatory Elite or cross-Allegiance
Stronghold passage. These are required future content tests, not a claim that
the current character-builder prototype implements them.
