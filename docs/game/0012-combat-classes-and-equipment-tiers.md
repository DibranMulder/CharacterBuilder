# Combat Classes and 1–120 equipment tiers

## Curation boundary

This pass defines class identity, equipment silhouettes, armor-set families,
and weapon lines. DESIGN-0009 now sets the acquisition categories: default Base
gear through NPC shops, special drops and upgrades through content/crafting and
eligible player trading. Exact item sources, recipes and drop tables remain
separate Acquisition Entries.

The current `source` string on item definitions is therefore provisional. A
production model should not embed one source into an Item because one Item may
come from a shop, quest, recipe, event, chest, and several creature drop tables.
Later, an **Acquisition Entry** should link one Item to one acquisition method
with its own requirements, location, cost, probability, and availability.

## Proposed launch Combat Classes

Combat Class remains separate from Lineage. Every Lineage may choose every
Combat Class; Lineage determines the body rig and equipment-art variant, while
Combat Class determines combat actions and equipment permission.

| Combat Class | Combat promise | Primary weapons | Armor silhouette |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vanguard | Guard, counters, formation play, dependable melee | One-Handed Sword, One-Handed Axe, One-Handed Blunt, One-Handed Spear, Shield | Heavy plate, broad shoulders, closed or open helm |
| Ravager | Slow committed swings, stagger, armor breaking, risk and reward | Two-Handed Sword, Two-Handed Axe, Two-Handed Blunt, Polearm | Heavy or reinforced medium armor, open arms, weight-forward boots |
| Ranger | Ranged pressure, weak-point shots, traps, mobile fieldcraft | Bow, Crossbow, Spear | Medium leather and light mail, compact hood, bracers, practical boots |
| Duelist | Alternating paired-weapon attacks, evasion, bleeds, and precise counters | Two permitted One-Handed Weapons chosen from Dagger, Sword, and Axe | Light leather and cloth, asymmetric shoulder, fitted gloves, soft shoes |
| Arcanist | Elemental projectiles, zones, control, and fragile burst | Wand, Staff | Layered elemental robes, large readable sleeves, circlet or soft hat |
| Warden | Radiance healing and protection, Gloam curses and life transfer, or a balance of both | Wand, Staff | Polarity robes with asymmetric light and dark materials, open face, paired luminous and umbral focus details |

This six-Class roster covers every approved Weapon Family. Shared weapons are
intentional: a Spear behaves differently in the hands of a Ranger and Vanguard
because the Combat Class supplies the abilities. The Duelist alone receives
Dual Wield permission.

## Weapon permission matrix

| Weapon or Equipment Family | Vanguard | Ravager | Ranger | Duelist | Arcanist | Warden |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| One-Handed Sword | Yes | — | — | Yes | — | — |
| Two-Handed Sword | — | Yes | — | — | — | — |
| One-Handed Axe | Yes | — | — | Yes | — | — |
| Two-Handed Axe | — | Yes | — | — | — | — |
| Spear | Yes | — | Yes | — | — | — |
| Polearm | — | Yes | — | — | — | — |
| Crossbow | — | — | Yes | — | — | — |
| Bow | — | — | Yes | — | — | — |
| Wand | — | — | — | — | Yes | Yes |
| Staff | — | — | — | — | Yes | Yes |
| Dagger | — | — | — | Yes | — | — |
| One-Handed Blunt | Yes | — | — | — | — | — |
| Two-Handed Blunt | — | Yes | — | — | — | — |
| Shield | Yes | — | — | — | — | — |
| Second One-Handed Weapon | — | — | — | Yes | — | — |

Grip remains authoritative. A Vanguard may place a Shield beside a permitted
One-Handed Weapon. A Duelist instead places a second permitted One-Handed
Weapon in Off Hand; the two weapons may use different permitted families. A
Two-Handed Weapon always reserves both hands.

## Equipment cadence from 1–120

Use twelve main visual tiers, each lasting ten Adventure Levels. Every tier has
a Base form for the first five levels and a Refined form for the second five.
The Refined form reuses the silhouette and animation overlay but adds trim,
material polish, particles, or a small attachment. This produces an upgrade
every five levels without demanding twenty-four unrelated armor concepts per
Class.

| Tier | Base requirement | Refined requirement | Intended power band |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 6 | 1–10 |
| 2 | 11 | 16 | 11–20 |
| 3 | 21 | 26 | 21–30 |
| 4 | 31 | 36 | 31–40 |
| 5 | 41 | 46 | 41–50 |
| 6 | 51 | 56 | 51–60 |
| 7 | 61 | 66 | 61–70 |
| 8 | 71 | 76 | 71–80 |
| 9 | 81 | 86 | 81–90 |
| 10 | 91 | 96 | 91–100 |
| 11 | 101 | 106 | 101–110 |
| 12 | 111 | 116 | 111–120 |

Quality is separate from Tier. A Rare level-26 Riversteel item is still Tier 3;
rarity may add stats or a special effect but does not invent a new progression
band.

## Standard armor-set contents

The standard humanoid Class set contains six visible pieces:

1. Head
2. Shoulders
3. Chest
4. Hands
5. Legs
6. Feet

### Accepted centaur exception — 2026-09-08

Grove Centaurs cannot equip Legs or Feet items: no pants, boots, invisible
stat-only equips, or automatic replacement barding. Their Class set uses Head,
Shoulders, Chest and Hands; compatible weapons and accessories remain usable.
This applies equally to all Grove Centaur variants and Combat Classes. The
server must reject unsupported slots, not merely hide them in the client.
Set completion counts only the four supported pieces; future set bonuses must
not require equipping pants or boots. Numerical balance must be checked across
topologies rather than silently reintroducing the forbidden slots.

The catalog totals below describe globally available item definitions, not a
promise that every Lineage can equip every record; the six-piece totals remain.

Capes are generic equipment and never mandatory parts of a Class armor set.
Neck, Ring, Relic, and Cape are shared accessory lines. Main Hand and Off Hand
are also separate weapon records.

Piece wording follows the Class silhouette:

| Combat Class | Head | Shoulders | Chest | Hands | Legs | Feet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vanguard | Helm | Pauldrons | Cuirass | Gauntlets | Greaves | Sabatons |
| Ravager | Warhelm | Spaulders | Harness | Grips | Chausses | Warboots |
| Ranger | Hood | Shoulderguard | Jerkin | Bracers | Trousers | Trailboots |
| Duelist | Mask | Shoulder Sash | Doublet | Gloves | Breeches | Softboots |
| Arcanist | Circlet | Epaulets | Robe | Gloves | Legwraps | Slippers |
| Warden | Diadem | Polarity Mantle | Vestment | Handwraps | Legwraps | Boots |

Example expansion: the Tier 1 Vanguard family creates `Roadwarden Helm`,
`Roadwarden Pauldrons`, `Roadwarden Cuirass`, `Roadwarden Gauntlets`,
`Roadwarden Greaves` and `Roadwarden Sabatons`, plus Refined versions at level
6. A separately acquired generic Cape may be worn with the set.

## Armor family matrix

| Tier | Levels | Vanguard | Ravager | Ranger | Duelist | Arcanist | Warden |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1–10 | Roadwarden | Hearthsplitter | Greenpath | Quickstep | Candlewick | Candleveil |
| 2 | 11–20 | Copperleaf Guard | Boarhide | Brambletrail | Foxglove | Moonglass | Moonhalo |
| 3 | 21–30 | Riversteel | Stonehowl | Rainfeather | Silversash | Starling | Dawngloam |
| 4 | 31–40 | Stormward | Thunderhide | Cloudpiercer | Windlace | Skyglass | Tempest Veil |
| 5 | 41–50 | Mireguard | Bogbreaker | Miststrider | Gloamfox | Fenlight | Fen Eclipse |
| 6 | 51–60 | Cinderplate | Ashmaul | Glasshawk | Emberstep | Flamequartz | Ashen Halo |
| 7 | 61–70 | Crownroad | Ironmane | Farwatch | Roseblade | Dawnscript | Sunshadow |
| 8 | 71–80 | Runebastion | Runefang | Moontracker | Nightpetal | Astral Ink | Equinox |
| 9 | 81–90 | Deepward | Obsidian Roar | Holloweye | Shadeglass | Crystal Veil | Deep Eclipse |
| 10 | 91–100 | Starforged | Worldbreaker | Cometseeker | Eclipse | Constellation | Celestial Balance |
| 11 | 101–110 | Veilguard | Riftreaver | Horizon Hunter | Veilstep | Veilweaver | Threshold Veil |
| 12 | 111–120 | Everdawn | Last Thunder | Farstar | Dawnswift | High Chronicle | Eternal Twilight |

The names describe visual identity only. `Mireguard` does not mean the set must
drop in Gloamfen, and `Deepward` does not guarantee Underdeep acquisition.

## Weapon line matrix

Each cell is one named weapon record. Base and Refined forms use the Tier's two
requirements. Exact acquisition remains unassigned.

| 12 | Farstar Crossbow | Farstar Bow | Chronicle Wand | High Chronicle Staff | Everdawn Shield | Dawnswift Dagger | First Bell Mace | Last Gate Maul |

## Catalogue scale

If every Base and Refined form becomes a separate Item record, this launch plan
produces:

| Group | Calculation | Item records |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Class armor | 12 tiers × 6 Classes × 6 pieces × 2 forms | 864 |
| Weapon and Shield lines | 12 tiers × 14 families × 2 forms | 336 |
| Generic Capes and accessories | Deferred | — |
| Total defined by this document |  | **1,200** |

That count is appropriate for a long-running MMO database but too much unique
art for the first playable slice. The art-efficient implementation is:

- 72 base armor-set concepts: twelve for each of six Classes.
- 168 base weapon/shield concepts: twelve for each of fourteen families.
- Refined records reuse the base silhouette with a material, trim, attachment,
  or particle overlay.
- Each base concept is adapted to the approved body families rather than being
  baked into one Lineage sprite.

## Accepted curation decisions

- Vanguard, Ravager, Ranger, Duelist, Arcanist, and Warden are the starting
  Combat Classes.
- Duelists use two permitted One-Handed Weapons and do not use Shields.
- Wardens are polarity mages using Radiance, Gloam, or an Eclipse balance;
  Arcanists remain elemental mages.
- Full armor concepts advance every ten levels with a Refined midpoint at five.
- Capes are generic items rather than Class-set pieces.

Bulk Item records and equipment artwork still wait for talent-tree and naming
curation. The first full Class trees are drafted in
[`0013-class-talent-trees.md`](0013-class-talent-trees.md).
